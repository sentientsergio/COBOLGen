## Sprint 3: Knowledge Base Setup for RAG (Weeks 4-5)

### Sprint Goal

Set up the Knowledge Base and implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the context of code generation.

### User Stories

- **US005**: As a **data engineer**, I want to **create a knowledge base of COBOL resources**, so that **the agent can use it for contextual code generation**.
- **US006**: As a **developer**, I want the **agent to utilize RAG**, so that **the generated code aligns with domain-specific knowledge**.

### Tasks

- Curate and index COBOL documentation and sample code.
- Implement a retrieval system to interface between the agent and the knowledge base.
- Modify the Autogen agent to use RAG during code generation.

### Deliverables

- Functional knowledge base accessible to the agent.
- Autogen agent enhanced with RAG.
- Demonstrations showing improved code generation using context.

---

## Sprint 4: Automated Code Review and Testing Framework (Weeks 5-6)

### Sprint Goal

Develop automated code review capabilities using LLMs and establish a testing framework for continuous integration.

### User Stories

- **US007**: As a **QA engineer**, I want to **automate code reviews**, so that **code quality is consistently maintained**.
- **US008**: As a **developer**, I want a **testing framework**, so that **I can ensure the correctness of generated code**.

### Tasks

- Integrate LLMs for automated code review and suggestions.
- Set up testing frameworks (`pytest`, COBOL testing tools).
- Implement continuous integration (CI) workflows using GitHub Actions.

### Deliverables

- Automated code review process in place.
- Testing framework operational with initial test cases.
- CI workflows configured for the project repository.

---

## Sprint 5: MVP Release and User Feedback (Weeks 6-7)

### Sprint Goal

Deploy the MVP to a staging environment and collect feedback from stakeholders to guide future development.

### User Stories

- **US009**: As a **stakeholder**, I want to **interact with the MVP**, so that **I can provide feedback on its functionality**.
- **US010**: As a **product owner**, I want to **gather user feedback**, so that **we can prioritize future enhancements**.

### Tasks

- Deploy the MVP to a staging or demo environment.
- Prepare demonstration materials and user guides.
- Collect and analyze feedback from stakeholders and potential users.

### Deliverables

- Deployed MVP accessible to stakeholders.
- Feedback documentation and analysis.
- Updated product backlog with new user stories based on feedback.

## Subsequent Sprints: Continuous Improvement (Weeks 7 onwards)

### Approach

- **Sprint Planning**: At the start of each sprint, select high-priority items from the product backlog.
- **Development and Testing**: Implement features, enhancements, and fixes.
- **Review and Retrospective**: At the end of each sprint, review progress with stakeholders and reflect on process improvements.
