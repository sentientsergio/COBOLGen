# COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot Planning Document: Proving the Concept for Synthetic COBOL Data Generation

## Introduction

This planning document lays out the steps for implementing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to prove the concept of synthetic COBOL data generation for benchmarking LLM translation tools. The plan is directly informed by our inception and methodology documents, ensuring consistency across all phases of implementation. This document serves as a 'plan of plans,' outlining key phases and activities, allowing for more detailed, step-by-step planning to be developed in separate documents as we move forward.

## Project Phases Overview

The COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot project will be divided into the following major phases:

- **Phase 1: Preparation & Environment Setup**
- **Phase 2: Requirements Gathering & Initial Input Documentation**
- **Phase 3: Agentic AI and RAG Development**
- **Phase 4: COBOL Synthetic Data Generation**
- **Phase 5: Validation and Evaluation of Generated Data**
- **Phase 6: Iteration & Refinement**
- **Phase 7: Reporting & Documentation**

Each phase will be addressed in greater detail below.

## Phase 1: Preparation & Environment Setup

**1.1 Development Environment Creation**

- **Local Dev Environments**: Set up local development environments for each team member involved in the pilot, ensuring compatibility with the core tools and libraries required for Autogen, Python, RAG implementations, and COBOL.
- **Cloud-Based Development**: Set up a cloud-based development environment for easier team collaboration. Platforms like AWS or Azure should be configured to provide virtual environments with necessary dependencies.

**1.2 Repository Setup**

- **GitHub Repository (COBOLGen)**: Create a GitHub repository named **COBOLGen** to house all relevant documents and code. This repository will be used to store the inception document, methodology document, and literature review, along with the pilot projectâ€™s development and synthetic data generation scripts.
- **Access Control & Versioning**: Implement access control and set up proper versioning to manage code changes and document updates effectively.

**1.3 Tooling and Dependencies**

- **Autogen Setup**: Install and configure the Autogen framework for Agentic AI. This will be a critical component for generating the synthetic COBOL projects.
- **RAG Framework**: Set up necessary Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tooling, ensuring compatibility with existing COBOL code repositories or other relevant knowledge bases.
- **Dependency Management**: Establish a system for managing Python dependencies (e.g., using `pipenv` or `poetry`) to ensure consistent setups across different environments.

## Phase 2: Requirements Gathering & Initial Input Documentation

**2.1 Expert Input Documentation**

- Collaborate with COBOL experts to gather business requirements for the synthetic COBOL applications. This may involve interviews, workshops, or structured brainstorming sessions.
- **JSON/YAML Specification**: Document these requirements in a machine-readable format, such as JSON or YAML, for direct use by the Autogen framework.

**2.2 Feature Specification**

- Identify the key COBOL features that need to be tested in the synthetic programs (e.g., file handling, indexed file operations, COPY statements).
- Draft a requirements document that outlines these features and defines how they will be exercised in the generated projects.

## Phase 3: Agentic AI and RAG Development

**3.1 Autogen Agents for COBOL Generation**

- **Agent Team Development**: Design and implement agents using Autogen, with each agent being responsible for a distinct part of the synthetic COBOL project (e.g., business logic, input/output handling, file processing).
- **Agent Training**: Develop initial training scripts to help the agents understand their specific tasks based on the documented requirements.

**3.2 Retrieval-Augmented Generation Integration**

- **Knowledge Base Setup**: Integrate RAG with existing COBOL code repositories, documentation, and other relevant resources.
- **Agent-RAG Interaction**: Implement mechanisms to allow the agents to interact with the RAG knowledge base during code generation, ensuring contextually enriched output.

## Phase 4: COBOL Synthetic Data Generation

**4.1 Initial Project Generation**

- **Scope Definition**: Define the scope of the synthetic COBOL project based on business requirements and expert inputs. The first iteration should focus on generating a small but representative project that exercises a variety of COBOL features.
- **Project Planning by Agents**: Use Autogen to autonomously generate the initial plan for the project, including different COBOL programs and their interrelations.

**4.2 Code Generation**

- **Module Creation**: Generate individual modules or programs within the COBOL project. Modules may represent different business functions (e.g., payroll, transaction management).
- **Copybook Development**: Create shared copybooks that are utilized across the project to standardize data formats and reuse code effectively.

## Phase 5: Validation and Evaluation of Generated Data

**5.1 Automated Testing Setup**

- **Unit Testing**: Develop unit tests to validate the correctness of individual COBOL programs and ensure adherence to the provided specifications.
- **Integration Testing**: Set up integration tests to verify that all generated components work together as a cohesive system, simulating real-world enterprise use cases.

**5.2 Benchmarking Against LLM Translation Tools**

- Use generated COBOL projects to benchmark LLM-based translation tools, evaluating the accuracy and efficiency of the translation output.
- Metrics will include semantic correctness, logic preservation, and edge case handling.

## Phase 6: Iteration & Refinement

**6.1 Feedback Loop**

- **Expert Review**: Review the generated COBOL projects with human experts to validate the relevance and accuracy of business logic.
- **Agent Iteration**: Refine the Autogen agent behavior based on expert feedback and performance in initial testing.

**6.2 Continuous Improvement**

- **Knowledge Base Updates**: Update the RAG knowledge base with newly generated code and expert insights to improve future iterations.
- **Agent Refinement**: Enhance agents to better capture nuanced business requirements and more complex scenarios.

## Phase 7: Reporting & Documentation

**7.1 Documentation of Findings**

- **Project Report**: Compile a comprehensive report detailing the COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot, challenges faced, methodologies used, and the results achieved.
- **Codebase Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the generated COBOL code, Autogen agent scripts, and RAG integration to ensure reproducibility and facilitate handover.

**7.2 Presentation and Feedback**

- **Stakeholder Presentation**: Prepare a presentation summarizing the outcomes of the pilot, including key metrics, synthetic project examples, and benchmarking results.
- **Feedback Gathering**: Gather feedback from stakeholders and experts to determine next steps for scaling the synthetic data generation efforts.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This planning document provides a structured approach to developing an COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot for synthetic COBOL data generation using Autogen and RAG. The next steps involve executing each of the above phases, creating more detailed step-by-step plans for each sub-task, and refining the tools and techniques as we progress.
