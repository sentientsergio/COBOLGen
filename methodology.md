# Methodology for Applying Autogen and RAG to Generate Comprehensive COBOL Projects

\*\*1. Introduction
This document outlines a detailed methodology for leveraging Autogen (a Python-based Agentic AI framework) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate comprehensive COBOL projects. The goal is to synthesize complex, multi-source COBOL applications that include interconnected programs and copybooks, reflecting real-world legacy systems. These synthetic projects will enable benchmarking and evaluation of LLM translation tools, thereby contributing to the modernization of legacy COBOL systems.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop a robust pipeline using Autogen and RAG for generating interconnected COBOL components, such as source programs and copybooks.
- Create complete synthetic COBOL projects that replicate the structure, complexity, and dependencies of actual enterprise-level systems.
- Enable evaluation and benchmarking of LLM translation tools with rich, realistic datasets.

## 3. Approach Overview

The approach involves combining Autogen for autonomous decision-making and code generation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the generated output with contextual knowledge from COBOL repositories. The process can be broken down into the following key stages:

**3.1. Input from Human Experts**
Before the agent team begins generating the COBOL projects, it will receive initial prompting in the form of **business requirements** and specific **COBOL features** that must be included. This input will come from a team of human experts and former COBOL programmers who understand the desired business processes and features to be modeled. The requirements will be provided in a machine-readable format, such as **JSON** or **YAML**, to facilitate smooth integration into the Autogen framework. This initial guidance will include:

- **Business Requirements**: Descriptions of the business logic, workflows, and scenarios that the synthetic COBOL project should model.
- **Specific COBOL Features**: Key COBOL features that must be exercised in the generated projects, such as file handling, indexed files, COPY statements, and data manipulation operations.

**3.2. Autogen for COBOL Project Planning**
Autogen, a Python-based Agentic AI framework, will act as a team of autonomous agents that collaboratively plan out an entire COBOL project. Each agent is assigned different aspects of the project lifecycle, such as:

- **Project Scope Definition**: Agents use the provided JSON/YAML requirements to define the overall goals of the COBOL project, including what business logic and processes need to be modeled.
- **Component Assignment**: Agents autonomously decide on the specific programs, modules, and copybooks needed to meet the project scope, and assign responsibilities for generating each part.
- **Dependency Mapping**: The agents establish dependencies among the components, ensuring that different modules and copybooks can effectively interact within the final synthetic project.

**3.3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Contextual Enrichment**
RAG will be employed to ensure that the generated COBOL code is not only syntactically correct but also enriched with context drawn from real COBOL codebases and documentation:

- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Relevant COBOL-related documents, manuals, and pre-existing code repositories are fed into the RAG system, which serves as a knowledge base for the generation process.
- **Contextual Guidance**: During the generation process, the agents leverage the RAG knowledge base to retrieve contextually relevant information, such as appropriate syntax for certain business processes or how common data structures are represented in COBOL.

**3.4. Iterative Generation, Reflection, and Review Process**
The iterative nature of Autogen, combined with reflective agents, is particularly advantageous in generating comprehensive COBOL projects. This process can be broken down as follows:

- **Initial Draft Creation**: Agents generate an initial draft of each COBOL module or copybook, adhering to the project specifications based on the input from human experts.
- **Peer Review and Reflection by Agents**: Each module undergoes a peer review where other agents assess its completeness, adherence to the project's goals, and its ability to interact with other modules effectively. Agents also reflect on intermediate results, providing feedback for iterative improvement.
- **Revision and Reflection Loop**: If any discrepancies or deficiencies are identified, agents refine and iterate on the modules, reflecting on feedback to ensure continual improvement until the requirements are met.

**3.5. Dependency Validation and Integration**
After individual components have been reviewed and refined, the next phase involves integrating these components into a cohesive project:

- **Dependency Testing**: Each component is validated to ensure all dependencies are properly linked, such as calling copybooks from various programs or ensuring data sharing is consistent.
- **System Integration**: The entire project is assembled, and integration tests are conducted to ensure all parts of the project can work together as intended, simulating an enterprise-level COBOL application.

## 4. Key Considerations

- **Complexity and Realism**: The generated projects must reflect the intricacies found in real-world COBOL systems, including handling multi-module operations, data persistence, and business-critical workflows.
- **Human-Guided Requirements**: Input from human experts is essential for accurately reflecting business logic and ensuring that specific COBOL features are included in the synthetic projects.
- **Agent Coordination**: Effective communication and coordination between the autonomous agents are crucial to ensure that different parts of the project align and work seamlessly together.
- **Context Quality**: The quality of the retrieved contextual knowledge in RAG directly impacts the quality of the generated COBOL components. The knowledge base must be expansive and curated to include relevant, high-quality information.

## 5. Tools and Technologies

- **Autogen Framework**: Autogen, a Python-based Agentic AI framework, will be used to handle autonomous code generation and decision-making, enabling agents to work collaboratively to produce complex COBOL projects.
- **RAG Implementation**: Custom RAG models will be implemented to interact with COBOL-specific knowledge bases, ensuring that generated content maintains consistency with standard COBOL practices.
- **Input Formats**: Business requirements and specific feature requirements will be provided in machine-readable formats such as JSON or YAML, allowing agents to easily interpret and act on this input.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Automated unit testing and integration testing frameworks will be employed to validate the correctness of individual components and their integration into a full project.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- **Synthetic COBOL Projects**: Complete COBOL projects, composed of multiple source programs and shared copybooks, suitable for benchmarking translation tools.
- **Benchmarking Dataset**: A dataset of synthetic COBOL projects that can be used to evaluate the performance of LLM-based translation tools, providing insight into the challenges and efficacy of these tools in handling complex legacy systems.

## 7. Challenges and Mitigations

- **Complex Dependency Handling**: Managing the dependencies across different components can be challenging. This will be mitigated by leveraging the iterative agent review process to identify and correct issues early.
- **Knowledge Base Quality**: Ensuring that the RAG knowledge base is comprehensive and relevant will be an ongoing process. Periodic updates and expert validation of the knowledge base will help maintain quality.
- **Human-Agent Interaction**: The initial input from human experts must be accurate and comprehensive. Collaboration with subject matter experts will help mitigate the risk of missing key requirements or COBOL features.

## 8. Conclusion and Next Steps

This methodology outlines a systematic approach to leveraging Autogen and RAG for generating comprehensive COBOL projects that closely mirror real-world applications. The next steps involve setting up a prototype for a smaller COBOL project, testing the agent collaboration with human-provided input, and iterating on the knowledge base to ensure completeness.
