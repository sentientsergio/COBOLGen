# Literature Review: Techniques for Synthetic Data Generation and COBOL Translation

## 1. Introduction

This literature review explores methodologies and technologies for generating synthetic data for COBOL, specifically focusing on agentic AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarking tools. The goal is to provide context for synthetic data generation, particularly for enhancing machine learning (ML) tools aimed at translating legacy COBOL code to modern environments, such as Java or .NET.

## 2. Synthetic Data Generation Techniques

Synthetic data generation is a critical approach for various fields, including the modernization of legacy COBOL systems. As organizations strive to translate COBOL code into modern programming languages, synthetic data offers a means to generate datasets that accurately reflect the statistical properties of real-world data without privacy concerns[1].

- **Random Data Generation**: One method for synthetic data generation is random data creation, which involves generating data points based on predefined distributions, such as normal or uniform distributions. This is useful for scenarios where specific real-world constraints are not present[1].

- **Rule-Based Generation**: Another approach involves using predefined rules or logic to generate data that meets specific requirements, such as simulating financial transactions in COBOL programs. This method ensures that the generated data adheres to certain structural or relational properties found in real-world systems[1].

- **Bias and Fairness Considerations**: Synthetic data also addresses the issue of bias by generating balanced datasets that help mitigate the inherent class imbalances found in real data. By creating a wide range of synthetic scenarios, these techniques contribute to the development of more robust and generalizable models[1].

## 3. Advantages of Synthetic Data in COBOL Translation

The use of synthetic data for COBOL translation presents several key benefits:

- **Scalability**: Synthetic data can be generated at scale, providing ample training data for machine learning models, particularly in cases where real COBOL datasets are scarce[1].
- **Customization**: Synthetic data allows customization to reflect diverse characteristics of COBOL applications, such as data structures, transaction types, and specific business logic. This ensures that ML models are equipped to handle complex, real-world scenarios that may arise in legacy COBOL systems[1].
- **Privacy Preservation**: Since synthetic data is artificially generated, it helps address privacy concerns, allowing organizations to work with complex datasets without exposing sensitive information[1].

## 4. Agentic AI in Synthetic Data Generation

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can autonomously execute complex tasks by making independent decisions. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on human supervision, agentic AI is equipped to manage multifaceted tasks with minimal human intervention[1]. In the context of COBOL, agentic AI plays a significant role in breaking down the data generation process into smaller, manageable components—facilitating the creation of entire projects rather than just isolated code snippets. The ability of agentic AI to autonomously iterate, verify, and correct code makes it a powerful tool for generating synthetic COBOL datasets that can realistically reflect the complexities of legacy systems[1].

## 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the capabilities of large language models with real-time information retrieval to produce contextually rich responses[1]. RAG can significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generated for COBOL translation by incorporating information from existing COBOL documentation or code repositories. This helps in creating accurate and nuanced synthetic datasets that can better represent the various features and intricacies of COBOL, including copybooks, interdependencies, and unique data structures[1].

## 6. Related Works in Legacy Language Translation

- **Machine Translation of Legacy Code**: Recent research has focused on the automatic translation of legacy languages such as COBOL into modern languages. Studies have highlighted the challenges involved, including preserving semantic accuracy and dealing with complex interdependencies within legacy systems[1]. The integration of synthetic data in these translation processes has proven effective in ensuring that machine learning models are trained on a diverse and representative set of examples, ultimately improving their performance.
- **Benchmarking Translation Models**: LLM-based benchmarking tools, such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval, have been utilized to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in translating legacy languages. These benchmarks help assess the model's ability to handle multi-turn conversations, evaluate win-rates in translation tasks, and maintain instruction-following consistency, which is critical for assessing COBOL translation quality[1].

## 7. Tools and Technologies

- **LLM Platforms**: Tools like GPT-4 and other transformer-based models are pivotal for generating synthetic code samples and benchmarking their translations. These platforms provide the flexibility and capability to generate realistic COBOL samples that reflect real-world applications[1].
- **Validation Frameworks**: Effective benchmarking requires robust validation mechanisms. Tools such as unit testing frameworks can help verify the correctness of both the synthetic COBOL code and its translations. Using automated validation processes ensures that any generated code maintains its intended functionality[1].

## 8. Key Gaps and Opportunities

- **Project-Level Generation**: While existing research often focuses on generating isolated COBOL programs, the need for entire projects—including multiple COBOL sources and shared copybooks—remains largely unaddressed. This project aims to fill that gap by creating synthetic COBOL projects that reflect the full complexity of real-world legacy systems[1].
- **Advancing Agentic AI**: The application of agentic AI for synthetic data generation offers the potential to autonomously design and implement comprehensive COBOL projects. This represents an innovative approach that pushes the boundaries of current synthetic data generation capabilities[1].
- **Lack of Comprehensive Benchmarking Datasets**: There is a critical need for benchmarking datasets that capture the full spectrum of COBOL's complexity. By creating synthetic datasets that encompass a range of use cases and scenarios, this project will provide an essential tool for evaluating the effectiveness of LLM-based translation tools[1].

## 9. Conclusion

The literature on synthetic data generation and COBOL translation demonstrates the importance of generating realistic, complex examples that capture the intricacies of legacy systems. Techniques like agentic AI and RAG offer new pathways for addressing these challenges, enabling the creation of synthetic COBOL projects that can effectively benchmark the performance of translation tools. There are significant opportunities to advance current practices by focusing on project-level generation, leveraging advanced AI techniques, and ensuring the completeness and quality of synthetic datasets for legacy code translation.

## 10. Next Steps

- Develop a detailed methodology for applying agentic AI and RAG to the generation of comprehensive COBOL projects.
- Identify gaps in existing synthetic datasets and establish criteria for creating datasets that effectively benchmark translation tools.
- Create a pilot implementation for generating a small, interconnected COBOL project to validate the proposed approach.
