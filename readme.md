# COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot

## Overview

![Corpus Callosum](./banner.png)

The **COBOLGen Benchmark Pilot** aims to develop synthetic COBOL datasets that benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs) in translating COBOL programs to modern environments like Java or .NET. The project seeks to address the challenges posed by a scarcity of complex, diverse, and high-quality COBOL datasets by creating comprehensive synthetic examples that fully represent the nuances and complexities of real-world COBOL systems.

The project leverages **Autogen**, a Python-based Agentic AI framework, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, combining autonomous AI-driven generation with context-rich guidance to create realistic COBOL code and projects. These synthetic datasets will be used for benchmarking LLM tools in terms of their translation accuracy and efficiency.

This README provides a high-level description of the project and links to the core documents that have been developed so far.

- **Reflection**: Agents reflecting on intermediate results, providing feedback for iterative improvement to ensure high-quality output and alignment with business requirements.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhances the generation process with context from existing COBOL codebases, manuals, and domain-specific knowledge.
- **OpenAI o1-preview**: Used for generating and managing agent-based tasks effectively in synthetic data generation.
- **GPT-4o**: Provides the backbone for complex language generation tasks, helping create realistic COBOL code samples.
- **Anthropic Claude GPT 3.5**: Assists in understanding and refining generated COBOL data, ensuring semantic correctness and enhanced translation quality.

## Next Steps

- Finalize the proof of concept (POC) for generating synthetic COBOL-translation pairs.
- Continue refining the Autogen and RAG configurations to enhance the quality of generated datasets.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to iteratively improve the generated code based on real-world feedback.
